# Movie recommendation based on past viewings
The Python project uses K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm to predict if a movie is
recommended to watch and the probability of the viewer liking it. To extract
the information about the movie rating and genre, I used the library
rotten-tomatoes-scraper from PyPi. I used the pandas library and the sklearn
library to implement the algorithm. I also used the bokeh library to create a
2-D scatter plot of the movies I have viewed in the past.

## Libraries used
pandas
sklearn
bokeh
rotten-tomatoes-scraper

## Further plans for the project
Webscrape without using the rotten-tomatoes-scraper tool
Clean up the code with more use of functions
